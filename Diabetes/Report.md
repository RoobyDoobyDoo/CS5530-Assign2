Forgot to add the notebook or update the report.
Went back and downloaded the charts and uploaded them to thier own folder while I was at it.

C) The mean and standard deviation are close to the population's, even the median certering about the same point. 
But the percentiles varied quite a bit, this is not that much of a surprise though since it should vary.
Although the population data point was still almost always in or by the edges of the box or (25% of the median) of the bootstrap samples. 

The bootstrap samples reflected the population data pretty well.
Even most of the percentile data had something that related to the population data point
(like the overlapping amount of counts where the population line was).

We do see a lot more variation in the bootstrap data, but that's a given since that's what its purpose is.
Overall, looks like a pretty successful test with sampling the data.
